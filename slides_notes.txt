Slide one: Personal presentation 
* direct + mention that this PhD offer is my number one priority.

Slide two: Master’s thesis (1)

*research oriented internship,  working on Wireless sensor networks and IoT , precisely IEEE802.15.4
*  Our contribution is to suggest solutions for the collision of IEEE802.15.4 TSCH communication cells.

* The main cause of the problem is the distributed mechanism used to schedule the resources among the communication node.

* as in the figure more brief explanation ...

Slide three: Master’s thesis (2)

* We used the already existing 6top transactions in the network to achieve a local mutual exclusion.

* Our work won’t introduce any new overhead to the network, this important for an already congested network.

* as in the figure bla bla bla

* we achieved a reduction of 70% of the colliding packets.

*  in the internship I have dealt with distributed and centralized algorithms, I have learned the pros and cons for each of them, which is most likely beneficial for the PhD I’m applying for


Slide four:  edge clouding state of art
I will do a summary of the section state of art in the MEC-ConPaaS paper. 
I found this section very precious in understanding the problem. 


Slide Five: PhD topic And Prespective
